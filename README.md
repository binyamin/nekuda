# Nekuda
> A set of varied tools for creating your own static-site workflow.

## About

### The name
In Hebrew, the word _nekuda_ (נקודה) can be translated as "a point". This project is like the _dot_ in the letter "i", or the _period_ at the end of a sentence. It's just a bag of puzzle pieces.


## 💬 Open for comments
I'd love to hear your thoughts. If you're comfortable, share with me your initial impression [via GitHub discussions](https://github.com/binyamin/nekuda/discussions) or email (see my profile).

_Note: I'm not just blowing steam when I ask for your opinion. Discussion is part of why I love open-source._

## 🗺️ Roadmap
- Look over JSDoc comments
- Test the code somehow
- Make `index.js` a viable tool (see comments in file)
- Generate typedefs
